			<p><strong>Welcome</strong>  The purpose of this tool is to help you narrow your search along your information journey; this is not a diagnostic tool.

This tool allows you to choose a variety of factors related to your symptom, in order to help you narrow the potential medical conditions related to your symptom. This tool does not incorporate all the personal, health and demographic factors related to you, individually, that would allow a definitive cause or causes to be suggested.

The most reliable way to determine the cause of your symptom, and what to do, is to visit your health-care provider. Thank you for using the Symptom Checker.</p>
